/*
Problem Name: Coin Odyssey: The Quantum Matrix Adventure
Problem Level: Hard

Welcome to the digital wonderland where 0s and 1s come to life, and you are the fearless coder on a mission! Imagine a 
universe of binary magic, where every move takes you closer to treasure â€“ the sparkling 1s that are coins, and the 
mysterious 0s that are voids.

With two legendary moves up your sleeve, your quest begins: ie: Right and Down.

Your challenge is to write a code that unlocks the secret path, guiding you to amass the maximum number of golden 
coins scattered across this binary odyssey. Get ready to code your way to glory!
